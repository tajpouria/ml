# Introduction to Machine Learning

What is Machine Learning?

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or decisions. In supervised learning, the model is trained on a set of input-output pairs, where the input is also known as the feature or predictor, and the output is the target or response variable. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a mapping between the input and output variables to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

A common example of supervised learning is predicting house prices. In this case, the input features might include the number of bedrooms, the square footage of the house, the neighborhood, and other relevant information. The output variable is the price of the house. The algorithm is trained on a dataset of labeled examples, where each example contains the input features and the corresponding target price.

Supervised learning is also used for other types of problems, such as classification and regression. In classification problems, the output variable is a categorical variable, such as a binary label (e.g., spam or not spam) or a multiclass label (e.g., cat, dog, or bird). In regression problems, the output variable is a continuous variable, such as predicting the price of a house or the stock price of a company.

Regression problems are a common type of supervised learning problem, where the goal is to predict a numerical value or quantity. The input features are used to make a prediction about the target variable. Examples of regression problems include predicting the price of a house based on its features, predicting the weight of a person based on their height, and predicting the sales of a product based on its price.

### Difference between Regression and Classification

Regression and classification are two important types of supervised learning problems in machine learning. Both involve the use of labeled data to make predictions or decisions, but they differ in the type of output variable they are trying to predict.

Regression problems are those where the output variable is a continuous numerical value. The goal is to predict the value of a target variable based on input features. Examples of regression problems include predicting the price of a house based on its size, number of rooms, and location, or predicting the temperature of a city based on various weather features. The output of a regression algorithm is a range of values, rather than a discrete set of categories.

On the other hand, classification problems involve predicting the categorical class or label of a given input based on the features of the input. The output of a classification algorithm is a categorical variable or a discrete set of categories. For example, a spam filter is a common example of a binary classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether an email is spam or not. In a multiclass classification problem, such as image classification, the algorithm must predict one of several possible categories for a given image.
